Using both the gene identifiers and their synonyms, GSAn
retained 7 terms, 3 of them are synthetic covering 6 out of 7 genes

Figure 4 provides information about the annotated
genes within (GOA), the genes covered by GSAn, and

shows excellent gene coverage of 100% within the GOA
principle components obtained by PCA.
file. The second gauge shows that 86% of the genes
were covered with the GSAn analysis. The third gauge
shows that 34% of the genes share a term in both datasets.

From the annotation results we can say 5 out of 7 genes are annotated by  response to external biotic stimuli (GO:0043207). 3 out of 7 genes are annotated by protein metabolic process(GO:0019538) and 2 out of 7 by secretory granule lumen(GO:0034774).

Figure 6 displays the information content and the gene
coverage of the synthetic terms. Functional annotation
categories from lesional AD samples include protein metabolic process,
secretory granule lumen and response to external biotic stimuli.

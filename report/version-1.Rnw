                        % Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
                        % that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
                        % that authors should try to avoid such use.

\usepackage{amsmath}    % From the American Mathematical Society
                        % A popular package that provides many helpful commands

                        % package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000 thus
                        % preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline
                        % equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
                        % after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks
                        % as IEEEtran.cls normally does. amsmath.sty is already
                        % installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version
                        % and documentation can be obtained at:
                        % http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/



% Other popular packages for formatting tables and equations include:

%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty which improves the
% LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better appearances and
% additional user controls. array.sty is already installed on most systems.
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/

% V1.6 of IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can
% be used to generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc.

% Also of notable interest:
% Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating (automatically sized) equal
% width boxes. Available:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/supported/eqparbox/

% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.

\section{Introduction}

Atopic dermatitis (AD) or atopic eczema is an itchy, inflammatory skin condition characterised by poorly defined erythema with edema vesicles, and weeping in the acute stage and lichenification in the chronic stage. The global prevalence is 15-20 $\%$ in children and 1-3$\%$ in adults, posing a significant burden on health-care resources and patientsâ€™ quality of life \cite{nutten2015atopic}.\\

The etiological factors associated with the initiation and progress of the disease are known to be genetic, environmental and immunological that affects the epithelial barrier-immunity interplay \cite{peng2015pathogenesis}.\\

Clinical investigations and discoveries in molecular medicine have positively identified 46 genes linked to AD. Mutations in filaggrin (FLG) genes (influencing intermediate filament protein filaggrin expression) are most common in the AD diseased population, it affects 10-50$\%$ of AD patients worldwide.\\

Few additional barrier genes encoded by the epidermal differentiation complex (EDC) locus chromosome 1q21, including claudins, loricrin (LOR), involucrin (IVL), SPINK5, AND tmem79/matt, are also associated with AD.\\

The genes of innate immune system like NOD1, NOD2, TLR2, CD14, and DEFB1, that encode the integral factors in cutaneous immunologic response to non- specific antigens may also experience mutations and cause AD \cite{guttman2017atopic}.\\

Studies have identified FLG gene mutation to be the most significant risk factor for AD, followed by the genes in the type 2 T helper lymphocyte (Th2) signalling pathways. 
Additionally, gene profiling assays demonstrated AD is associated with decreased gene expression of epidermal differentiation complex genes and elevated Th2 and Th17 genes. Hypomethylation of TSLP and FCER1G in AD were also reported; and miR-155, which targets the immune suppressor CTLA-4, was found to be significantly over-expressed in infiltrating T cells in AD skin lesions \cite{guttman2017atopic, bin2016genetic}.

\section{Materials and Methods}

\subsection{Data Source}

Data came from MAARS

\subsubsection{Data Cleaning}

\subsection{Exploratory Data Analysis}

\subsection{Statistical Analysis}

The overarching goal of the statistical analysis was the determine the relevant genes from a transcriptomic datatset that are predictive of AD. The analysis plan was performed two-fold; the identification of genes highly associated with AD was first performed followed by assess the predictability of lesional status using a prediction model.

are firstly identified using a multiple testing framework with many parallel linear models. Secondly, sparse partial least squares (SPLS) was performed in determining genes that can best explain the variability in the outcome variable, a sample being lesional or not.

The statistical analysis plan was performed two-fold. 

\subsubsection{Differential Gene Expression Analysis}

Let $\mathcal{X} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
  1 & X_1\\
  1 & 
\end{bmatrix}$
Let $\mathcal{X}$ be a $(n \times 2)$ model matrix where the only covariate $X_i \in \{0, 1\}$ represents the lesional stats of sample $i$.
